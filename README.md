## Corpus-based language and dialect mapping

This project visualizes three datasets: 
	
	Twitter Corpus 
		(21.3 billion words, 2017-2022) 
		
	Corpus of Global Language Use
		(ISLRN: 951-235-998-601-3)
		(423 billion words, 2013-2019, from the Common Crawl)
		
	GeoWAC 
		(ISLRN: 946-519-559-042-9)
		(42 billion words; geographically-balanced gigaword corpora for 48 languages)

The per-country aggregates can be found in the *docs/data* folder as CSV files.
